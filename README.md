# bitburner-scripts
Repository of Bitburner scripts

its my own repository of what did coded for the game
yes it lack some because I only started using VScode after a while

note that you need to use typescript to use it
and that since I'm french I will mostly comment code in french

see the [specific README ](BeginnersGuide.md) for more details.

some scripts can be run with `--help` to explain what they do and how they should be used.

Example:

	run find_server.js --help

You can fork 
and discuss with me about thing by directly commenting code in commits.
I don't byte.
